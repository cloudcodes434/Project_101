1. Define the waves
Create a list of waves.

Each wave has a number of enemies and a spawn rate.

Example: Wave 1 spawns 5 enemies, one every second.

📍 2. Check if a player is nearby
Before spawning, check if any player is close to the spawn point.

Only spawn enemies if a player is within a certain radius (e.g. 100 studs).

This prevents enemies from spawning when no one is around.

🧍 3. Spawn enemies
Clone an enemy model from storage.

Place it at the spawn location.

Repeat this for the number of enemies in the wave.

💀 4. Track enemy deaths
When an enemy dies, decrease the “enemies alive” counter.

This helps you know when the wave is finished.

⏳ 5. Wait until all enemies are dead
After spawning all enemies, wait until the alive counter reaches zero.

This means the wave is complete.

🕒 6. Intermission
Wait a few seconds before starting the next wave.

You can show a countdown or message to players.

🔁 7. Repeat for the next wave
Move to the next wave in the list.

Repeat the same steps: check player, spawn, track deaths, wait, intermission.
